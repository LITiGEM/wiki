SpyTag and SpyCatcher are two binding partners that come from CnaB2 (immunoglobulin-llike collagen adhesin domain) of the FbaB protein, found in the invasive strains of S. pyogenes. SpyTag contains a reactive aspartate that forms a strong isopeptide bond with a reactive lysine residue in SpyCatcher when in close proximity. </p>

                            <p class="text-content-new">As a more immediate induction of cell aggregation, we aimed to develop a post-translational light switch in which cells are constitutively expressing either Intimin’ fusion proteins with SpyTag or an inactive version of SpyCatcher. Only upon light exposure, SpyCatcher is able to bind SpyTag resulting in a much faster response than transcriptional induction. This is achieved by incorporating a photocaged unnatural amino acid (UAA), Ne-methyl-L-lysine, in place of the reactive lysine in SpyCatcher required for the covalent bond formation with the SpyTag aspartate residue. Upon exposure to UV light (20min, 365nm), the “cage” group in the unnatural photocaged amino acid is cleaved off revealing the native amino acid and a biologically active protein. This approach also adds a layer of bio-containment as cells will only function when externally supplied with UAA.</p>

                            <p class="text-content-new">To achieve this, we introduced an amber stop codon (TAG) in place of the reactive Lys 31 residue (Lys31X) in SpyCatcher. Amberless E. coli cells also have to express pyrrolysyl tRNA (pyIT/tRNAPylCUA) from M. mazei and pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase from M. barkeri and the UAA must be supplemented in the media. The pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase catalyses the acylation of the suppressor tRNACUA with the UAA. During translation, the UAG amber codon in the mRNA is recognized by the acylated tRNACUA and the UAA will be added to the growing polypeptide chain. The orthogonality of this system has shown to work in both E. coli and mammalian cells.</p>

These cells would also express photocaged (inactive) recombinant silicatein on their surface.

As shown in Figure1, only J23151-GFP (positive control) had a significant difference in fluorescence compared to R0040-GFP (negative control) WT cells and the Luria Broth (LB) in both dark and Blue-light conditions.  Pblind-GFP had no significantly different fluorescence level compared to the LB baseline, negative control or WT cells in either condition. This is expected, as the EL222 protein is required for blue-light inducible transcriptional activation.</p>

                                <p id="applications-tissue-description2">In order to form structures cells need to form dynamic non-covalent formations in adherens junctions that allow constant remodelling of the structure while still maintaining a high degree of rigidity. The cell adhesion proteins in these junctions are stabilized via connections with the cytoskeleton, most notably actin filaments. Cells forming synthetic tissues therefore need to have the ability to form these connections rapidly in a cell culture that is dividing. In mammalian cells transcription takes around 30 min, translation (incl. mRNA export) another 30 min and further protein sorting and processing is dependent on the the type of protein. For the purpose of forming structural patterns, a photosensitive cell adhesion system therefore needs to be post-translational and instantaneous.</p>

                    <p class="text-content-new">The light sensitive E. coli detects sunlight (blue light) to repress bioluminescence encoded by LuxCDABE. In the presence of light, transcription of the LuxCDABE for the production of Luciferase and substrates will be inhibited by EL222 binding onto our blue light repressible promoter (PBLrep). In the dark, the inhibition will be released and bioluminescence will be induced. This ensures that our bulb is only active in the dark and excess buildup of substrates and luciferase, potentially toxic, will be prevented. This system also ensures that cell concentration dependent luminescence through quorum sensing is surpassed and our cultures can fluoresce independently and in response to light changes.</p>

                    <p class="text-content-new">The blue light repressible promoter (PBLrep) consists of the 18bp DNA binding region of EL222, a natural photosensitive DNA-binding protein from the marine bacterium Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594, positioned between the -35 and -10 regions of the RNAP binding site. In the dark, EL222 is inactive as its N-terminal LOV domain represses its DNA-binding C-terminal HTH domain. In the daytime, exposure to blue light (450nm) results in the LOV-HTH interaction to be released, allowing it to dimerize and bind its binding region, causing steric hindrance to RNAP binding, ultimately repressing transcription. Therefore, only at nighttime the transcription of LuxCDABE will occur.</p>

                    <p class="text-content-new">Cells would have been transformed with (construct) and (construct el222) (constitutively expressing EL222 protein) plasmids. Cells would have been either kept in the dark or exposed to blue light (465 nm) for 6 hours and bioluminescence levels would have been measured by aliquoting samples into a 96-well plate every 6 hours using FLUOstar plate reader.</p>

                    <p class="text-content-new">Through mathematical modelling, the optimal dimensions and structure of the bulb were determined (click here for modelling details). The circular structure of the LIT bulb maximizes the exposure of Cyanobacteria to sunlight. A pump was introduced to ensure the cells remain suspended and the cell culture is homogeneously distributed throughout the LIT bulb. A three-way manual valve was introduced to allow for the easy replacement of media once every 12 months. A filter will be added to the valve to allow media to be replaced without removing the cell culture.</p>

                    <p class="text-content-new">Biosafety and microbial containment considerations are of particular importance in the manufacturing design process of the LIT Bulb, as our product intends to coexist with the wider population as a source of public illumination.</p>

                    <p class="text-content-new">The bulb has been designed to ensure biocontainment and prevent the interaction with our engineered microorganisms or their release into the environment.</p>

                    <p class="text-content-new">The energy strain for the production of bioluminescence by our engineered E. coli cells is so large that they would be outcompeted quickly by other microorganisms if they were to be released in the environment.</p>

                    <p class="text-content-new">Cyanobacteria will be engineered to secrete the glucose product from photosynthesis, thus they would be unable to sustain their growth when competing against other microbes in the environment if they were to be released.</p>
