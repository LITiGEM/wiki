            <h1 class="title">The Science behind LEGIT</h1>

            <ol class="text-content"> LEGIT is a mathematical model that determines the conditions required for optimal and rapid
                light activated expression of the protein intimin. Intimin is a protein expressed on the surface of our genetically
                engineered E. coli cells. It is used as an anchor on which we fuse our binding partners, SpyTag and SpyCatcher.
                Once SpyTags and SpyCatchers have attached to a particular cell they form a covalent bond. This binding allows our cells to aggregate into shapes. We ideally want to control the
                amount of intimin produced on the surface of our cells in order to control the amount of binding that takes place between our cells.
                <br>
                <br>
                Breakdown of the cellular mechanims involved in the expression of intimin:

                as it incorporates two innovative twists. The first  being rate kinetics that are dependent on light induced systems

                    <br>The first step of our LEGIT simulation involves determining the amount of EL222 dimers (EL222<sub>D</sub>) present in the cell.
                    EL222<sub>D</sub> are the transcription factors used to activate the expression of intimin in the cell. An EL222 <sub>D</sub> is produced from
                    the photo-activated dimerization of two EL222 monomers (EL222<sub>M</sub>) found in the cell. We wanted to establish this relationship
                    because once EL222<sub>D</sub> binds to the LuxI promotor, it starts to promote the transcription of mRNA.

                    binds to the LuxI promoter. We took dilution rates due to both cell growth/division and mRNA degradation into consideration
                    when accounting for mRNA equilibriums.

                    The next step of our model seeks to establish the production levels of the surface protein intimin from translation.
                    The rate of intimin production is subject to changes in the rate of mRNA translation. Once intimin is translated, it is
                    continuously transported to the surface of the E. Coli cell, therefore intimins' concentration in the cell decreases continuously. To account
                    for fluctuation, we created a function that takes the transport rate of intimin to the surface to the E. Coli cells into consideration.

                <p class="text-content"> We expect the speed at which intimin is transported to the surface of the cell to decrease over time.
                    This is because as time passes there will be a decrease in available space for intimin on the cell surface. We adapted the
                    Michaelis Menten equation to allow for the consideration of the intimin proteins already occupying space on the cell surface (P<sub>Surface</sub>)
                    and the maximum available space for intimin proteins on the cell surface. The variable  was set as the limit for the
                    maximum number of intimin proteins that can be expressed on the cell surface, thus preventing any other proteins from becoming expressed.

                the cell surface as being the limiting step in this cell mechanism. Because speed is essential to our LIT technology
                we decided to optimise the rate limiting parameters within the ODE describing intimin transfer to the cell surface.

            <p class="text-content">Our LEGIT model is initiated with the photoactivation of our EL222<sub>M</sub> transcription factor.
                Therefore, we thought it would be interesting to evaluate the effect different light intensities had on the concentration
                and rate of expression of intimin on the cell surface. The range of values we selected to test fell within the range of
                0 W/cm<sup>2</sup> and 70 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, where 0 W/cm<sup>2</sup> represented our system in its off state and 70 W/cm<sup>2</sup> represented
                the maximum light intensity E. coli can withstand before they started to die.

                    The concentration of intimin expressed on the cell surface at a light intensity of 0 W/cm<sup>2</sup> was assumed to not be

                    One could thus evaluate the effect light intensity has on the production of dimers from EL222.
                    The amount of dimerization taking place could be measured by looking at the distance the EL222 extracts travel down
                    the SDS page, where a shorter distance will be travelled by the EL222 dimers due to its larger molecular weight.

                <p class="text-content">We decided to optimize the rate-limiting parameters present in the ODE which describes
                    the transport of intimin from the cell cytoplasm to the cell surface. The two rate-limiting parameters identified were: V<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>m</sub>.
                    Where K<sub>m</sub> represents the affinity the surface of the cell has for the intimin protein and V<sub>max</sub> represents
                    the maximum rate at which intimin can be expressed on the surface of the cell. The maximum and minimum values that could be assigned to each parameter
                    were determined from literature. We decided to optimize the values for each parameter using two approaches, Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Sampling.

            <p class="text-content">Once we determined increasing light intensity causes a proportional increase to the concentration
                and rate of expression of intimin on the surface of the cell, we decided to evaluate the effect other light properties would
                have on our system. More specifically, we decided to evaluate whether light pulsing had an effect on intimin expression.
                This would allow us to see whether continuously activating and deactivating our light induced system could result in the expression
                of a larger concentration of intimin on the surface of the cell.

                <br>
                <br>We first ran a control simulation, where we introduced one long pulse of 7 hours of light, in order to
                ensure we received a curved response that would simulate the activation and deactivation of our cellular mechanisms
                for a defined period of time.</p>

                <br>From Figure 9 it is evident the behavior of all the species produced, after each step involved in the expression
                    of intimin, is represented in a dumb-bell shaped curve. This is justifiable, as when the light is turned off we
                    expect the rate of product production to be smaller than the rate of product degradation. Therefore, as time passes
                    the concentration of each product from each step is expected to decrease.

                    <br> We then wanted to evaluate the effect pulsing for periods of 4 hours would have on the expression of intimin

                    We established the best costing trade-off to be when operating our technology
                    at a light intensity of 30 W/cm<sup>2</sup> with a 4.5-hour pulsing frequency.

                <h1 class="subtitle">Pharmaceutical Industry</h1>

                <p class="text-content">We envision our model could be adapted and used by Pharmaceutical companies to optimize their
                    manufacture operation conditions to obtain a high product yield. Focus could be placed on identifying the bottleneck
                    of the manufacturing process, or the stage at which the greatest concentration of product is lost in the manufacturing process.
                    Each differential equation could represent a batch mode taking place in one-unit operations, where the product concentration
                    changes over time. For each equation, we would include the loss of product in the form of degradation rates, as this would
                    signal a decrease in product concentration. For each of these conditions a discount factor for the product concentration
                    would need to be introduced. The product loss could be due to: the product getting stuck in crevices in the machinery;
                    product degradation due to a limited half-life; and/or product aggregation to other cellular debris. This model would help
                    companies determine the unit operation at which the largest product loss is experienced.

                <h1 class="subtitle">Stock market</h1>
                <p class="text-content"> Similarly, our model could be adapted to characterize the volatile nature of publically listed
                    companies’ share prices in the stock market. One could divide the differential equations into the main factors which
                    affect the share price of a company. These factors could be: the Lombard Rate, which is set by the European Central Bank;
                    the desirability of a company’s shares (set as a function of the market share a company has); and a company’s share price.
                    A decrease in the Lombard rate would result in an increase in the share price of a company, which would lead to an increase
                    in the number of the company’s shares bought from the stock market resulting in an increase of market share the company was
                    gaining in its industrial sector. Through our model financial institutions could identify the time it takes for a change in
                    the Lombard Rate to result in a change in the company’s market share. Simultaneously, once the bottleneck is identified,
                    the company’s management team could optimize parameters (such as advertising or product diversification) to minimize the
                    time taken for this change to occur.

            <div class="text-section">
                <p class="text-content">  Throughout the summer we had a bilateral collaboration with the iGEM SVCE 2017 team from India.
                    Our collaboration started off with us sending each other useful sources and tutorials on how to approach modelling for
                    cellular mechanisms, as neither team considered itself an expert in the field. Once we both started forming the differential
                    equations for our respective models, we sent each other documents with a summary of our ODEs and provided feedback to each other.
                    Both teams provided constructive feedback on how to present complex information in a simple manner to make it easy to understand
                    for non-modellers, while at the same time helped refine each other’s differential equations.
