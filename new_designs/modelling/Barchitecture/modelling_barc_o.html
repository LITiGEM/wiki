            <ol class="text-content"> LEGIT is a model that determines the conditions required for optimal and rapid
                light activated expression of the protein intimin. Intimin is a protein expressed on the surface of our genetically
                engineered E. coli cells. It is used as an anchor on which we fuse our binding partners, SpyTag and SpyCatcher.
                Once SpyTags and SpyCatchers have attached to a particular cell they start to bind to other SpyTags and SpyCatchers
                attached to other cells. This binding allows our cells to aggregate into shapes. We ideally want to control the
                amount of intimin produced on the surface of our cells so that we can control the amount of binding that takes place between our cells.

                    <br>The first step of our LEGIT simulation involves determining the amount of EL222 dimers (EL222<sub>D</sub>) present in the cell.
                    EL222<sub>D</sub> are the transcription factors used to activate the expression of intimin in the cell. An EL222 <sub>D</sub> is produced from
                    the photo-activated dimerization of two EL222 monomers (EL222<sub>M</sub>) found in the cell. We wanted to establish this relationship
                    because once EL222<sub>D</sub> binds to the LuxI promotor, it starts to promote the transcription of mRNA.

                    The rate of intimin production is subject to changes in the rate of mRNA translation. Once intimin is translated, it is
                    continuously transported to the surface of the E. Coli cell, therefore intimins' concentration in the cell also decreases. To account
                    for fluctuation, we created a function that takes the transport rate of intimin to the surface to the E. Coli cells into consideration as well.

                    The values of V<sub>max</sub> represented in figure 8 are more realistic and significantly lower than

            <h1 class="title">Determining the effect light pulsing has on intimin expression</h1>

            <p class="text-content">Once we determined increasing light intensity causes a proportional increase to the concentration
                and rate of expression of intimin on the surface of the cell, we decided to evaluate the effect other light properties would
                have on our system. More specifically, we decided to evaluate whether light pulsing had an effect on intimin expression.
                This would allow us to see whether continuously activating and deactivating our light induced system could result in the expression
                of a larger concentration of intimin on the surface of the cell.

                <br>
                <br>We first ran a control simulation, where we introduced one long pulse of 7 hours of light, in order to
                ensure we received a curved response that would simulate the activation and deactivation of our cellular mechanisms
                for a defined period of time.</p>

                <img src="../../assets/Barch/Bac_1pulse.png" class="image-content" style="width:950px; height: 450px">
                <p class="text-content" style="margin-top: 0; padding-top:0"><i>Figure 9:</i> Evaluates the effect a single pulse has on the rate
                    kinetics of the expression of intimin
                    <br>
                <br>From Figure 9 it is evident the behavior of all the species produced, after each step involved in the expression
                    of intimin, is represented in a dumb-bell shaped curve. This is justifiable, as when the light is turned off we
                    expect the rate of product production to be smaller than the rate of product degradation. Therefore, as time passes
                    the concentration of each product from each step is expected to decrease.

                    <br>
                    <br> We then wanted to evaluate the effect pulsing for periods of 4 hours would have on the expression of intimin
                    on the surface of the cell.</p>

                    <br>From Figure 10 we discovered that if we pulse light on the cells for a period of 4 hours three times
                    within 24 hours, we experienced more than a 10-fold increase in the concentration of intimin expressed on the
                    surface of the cells.

                <p class="text-content">The biggest increase in the rate of intimin expression on the surface of the cells occurs
                    when the value of K<sub>m</sub> decreases and the values of V<sub>max</sub> increases. This is something we expected, as the lower the
                    value of K<sub>m</sub> the higher the affinity our cells’ membranes would have for intimin and therefore the faster the
                    transport of intimin to the cell surface. In addition, the higher the V<sub>max</sub> the faster the rate at which the reaction
                    occurs. Thus, the combination of both of these phenomena results in faster transport of intimin to the surface of the cell.</p>

                current labs could use to replace alternative technologies. We focused on identifying the main operational
                costs a user would incur, where we determined the most critical ones were: the light intensity they used to activate
                the E.coli cellular mechanism; and the frequency of light pulsing. We created a function in Python that took costs
                incurred for both methods into consideration, where we attempted to identify the most cost-efficient operational

                    Downstream Processing conditions to obtain a high product yield. Focus could be placed on identifying the bottleneck
                    of the manufacturing process, or the stage at which the greatest concentration of product is lost in the manufacturing process.
                    Each differential equation could represent a batch mode taking place in one-unit operations, where the product concentration
                    changes over time. For each equation, we would include the loss of product in the form of degradation rates, as this would
                    signal a decrease in product concentration. For each of these conditions a discount factor for the product concentration
                    would need to be introduced. The product loss could be due to: the product getting stuck in crevices in the machinery;
                    product degradation due to a limited half-life; and/or product aggregation to other cellular debris. This model would help
                    companies determine the unit operation at which the largest product loss is experienced.

                    companies’ share prices in the stock market. One could divide the differential equations into the main factors which
                    affect the share price of a company. These factors could be: the Lombard Rate, which is set by the European Central Bank;
                    the desirability of a company’s shares (set as a function of the market share a company has); and a company’s share price.
                    A decrease in the Lombard rate would result in an increase in the share price of a company, which would lead to an increase
                    in the number of the company’s shares bought from the stock market resulting in an increase of market share the company was
                    gaining in its industrial sector. Through our model financial institutions could identify the time it takes for a change in
                    the Lombard Rate to result in a change in the company’s market share. Simultaneously, once the bottleneck is identified,
                    the company’s management team could optimize parameters (such as advertising or product diversification) to minimize the
