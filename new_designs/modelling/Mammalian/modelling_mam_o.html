            <h1 class="title">The Science behind LAME</h1>

            <ol class="text-content"> LAME models the light activated expression of RFP protein within genetically engineered HEK 293 cells.
                When light shines onto our HEK 293 cells the photocleavable linker anchoring the RFP transcription factor, which is attached to a dCas9, on the outer membrane of the cell becomes cleaved.
                This photocleavage leads to the release of the transcription factor in the cell. The transcription factor is then guided to the RFP promoter in the cell nucleus with the help of the
                dCAS9 it is attached to. This mechanism could be used to induce the production of cadherin, the surface proteins that cause
                mammalian cells to adhere to each other, upon demand. Therefore, our technology could be used to guide cells with light to create highly specific ccellular tissues.

                <br>The first step of our simulation is the photocleavage of PhoCl, which results in the release of the RFP TF in the cytoplasm of the cell. Two degradation factors were introduced within our ODEs to account for the hald-life of the RFP TF and the

                <br> The second step of our simulation is the production of mRNA from transcription.
                In order for transcription to take place the TF<sub>C</sub> needs to be trasnported from the cytoplasm of the cell to the nucleus. The TF<sub>C</sub> is guided into the
                nucleus of the cell to the RFP promoter with the help of dCAS9. Once the TF<sub>c</sub> enters the nucleus of the cell it becomes TF<sub>N</sub>. The rate at which the TF<sub>N</sub> binds to the RFP promoter
                affects the rate at which transcription takes place. Two degradation factors were introduced t oaccount for the half-life of the mRNA<sub>N</sub> and the transport of the mRNA from the nucleus of the cell
                to the cytoplasm.</p>

                The third step of our simulation is the production of the RFP protein from translation. The change in concentration of the RFP protein is dependent on three main factors. Firstly, the rate at which mRNA is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, this is
                represented with the letter 'β'. Secondly, the rate of translation and finally the maximum amount of RFP protein a cell can express. A degradation term was introduced to represent the degradation of RFP over time because of dilution due to
                cell growth and the half-life of the RFP protein. </p>

                different light intensities had on the concentration and rate of expression of RFP protein in the cell. The range of values we selected to test fell within the range of 0 W/cm<sup>2</sup> and
                54 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, where 0 W/cm<sup>2</sup> represented our system in its off state and 54 W/cm<sup>2</sup> represented the maximum light intensity Mammalian cells can withstand

            <p class="text-content">We decided to optimize the rate-limiting parameters present in the ODE which describes the translation of RFP protein in the cell.

                The maximum and minimum values that could be assigned to each parameter were determined from papers. We decided to optimise the values for each parameter by using two approaches, a Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Sampling.</p>

            <p class="text-content"> We determined increasing light intensity has a directly proportional increase on the concentration
                and the rate of expression of RFP in the cell. We therefore decided to evaluate the effect other light properties would have on our system. More specifically, we decided to evaluate whether light pulsing had an effect on GRP expression. This would allow us to see whether continuously activating and
                deactivating our light induced system could result in the expression of a larger concentration of RFP at a faster rate in the cells.
                <br>
                <br>We first ran a control simulation, where we introduced one long pulse of 7 hours of light, to ensure we received a curved response that would simulate the activation and deactivation of our cellular mechanisms for a defined period of time. </p>

This is justifiable, as when the light is turned off we expect the rate of product production to become smaller than the rate of product degradation. Therefore, as time passes the concentration of each product from each step is expected to decrease, until eventually all the species from the product produced degrade.
                <br>
                <br> We then wanted to evaluate the effect pulsing for periods of 2 hours would have on the expression of intimin on the surface of the cell.</p>

In addition, the higher the V<sub>max</sub> the faster the rate at which the reaction occurs. Thus, the combination of both of these phenomena results in a faster transport of intimin to the surface of the cell.</p>

                <p class="text-content"> We ran a  Cost Analysis to ensure our LIT optogenetic tool was an affordable technology current labs could use to replace alternative technologies with.
                    We focused on identifying the main operational costs a user would incur, where we determined the most critical ones were: the light intensity they used to activate the E.coli cellular mechanism; and the frequency of light pulsing.
                    We created a function in Python that took costs incurred for both methods into consideration, where we attempted to identify the most cost-efficient operational conditions for our tool.</p>

                    <br> The simulaiton in Figure 13 was run for a period of 2 hours, where it was assumed a constant source of light would be present for the whole period of time. It is evident that the costs incurred increase directly
                    proportionally to the light intensity at which our optogenetic tool is operated at.
                    <br>
                    <br> We also decided to analyse the impact light pulsing would have on the overall process costs.</p>

                    <br>The simulation in Figure 14 was also run for a period of 2 hours, where it was assumed a constant light intensity of 40 W/cm<sub>2</sub> was used. Similarly to Figure 13, we see that an increase in the pulse duration results in a proportional increase in the cost of operation.
                <p class="text-content">We then decided to plot both the costs incurred for different light intensities and the pulsing durations on the same graph to evaluate their synergistic effect.</p>

                    <br> We decided to define the most optimum operating conditions for our optogenetic tool as those at which both lines intersect. Beyond the point of intersection it was evident that the operational costs
                    for the optogenetic tool were too high. Below the intersection point it was evident that the activity of the E.coli cell adhesion mechanism would
                    be too slow, and as one of the biggest selling points for our technolgy is its rapidity we decided it would not be feasible to
                    operate at such a slow rate. Therefore, the best trade-off was identified when operating at a light intensity of 30 W/cm<sup>2</sup> with a 4.5 hr pulsing frequency.</p>
