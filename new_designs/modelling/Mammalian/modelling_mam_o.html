            <h2 class="subtitle"> A mathematical model of how HEK 293 cells are guided to form structured tissues</h2>

            <h1 class="title">The Science behind LAME</h1>

            <ol class="text-content"> LAME models the light activated expression of RFP proteins within genetically engineered HEK 293 cells.
                When light shines onto our HEK 293 cells the photocleavable linker, which anchors the RFP transcription factor (TF) onto the outer membrane of the cell, becomes cleaved. The TF is attached to a dCas9,
                therefore, once the photocleavage occurs the TF is guided to the RFP promoter in the cell nucleus with the help of the dCas9. This mechanism could be adapted and used to induce the production of the surface proteins that cause
                mammalian cells to adhere to each other, cadherin, upon demand. As such, our technology could be used to guide cells with light to create highly specific ccellular tissues.

                <br>The first step of our simulation is the photocleavage of PhoCl, which results in the release of the RFP TF in the cytoplasm of the cell. We introduced two degradation factors within our ODEs, in order to account for the half-life of the RFP TF and the
                continual transport of TF from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of the cell.</p>

                <br> The second step of our simulation is the production of mRNA from transcription.
                In order for transcription to take place the TF needs to be transported from the cytoplasm of the cell to the nucleus. The TF is guided into the
                nucleus of the cell to the RFP promoter with the help of dCAS9. The rate at which the TF enters the nucleus of the cell and binds to the RFP promoter
                affects the rate at which transcription takes place. We incorporated two degradation factors to account for the half-life of the mRNA and the transport of the mRNA from the nucleus of the cell
                to the cytoplasm.</p>

                The third step of our simulation is the production of the RFP protein from translation. The change in concentration of the RFP protein is dependent on three main factors. Firstly, the rate at which mRNA is transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, this is
                represented with the letter 'β'. Secondly, the rate of translation, represented by 'k<sub>3</sub>', and thirdly the maximum amount of RFP protein a cell can express, represented by the letter 'η'. A degradation term was introduced to represent the degradation of
                RFP over time because of dilution due to cell growth and the limited half-life of the RFP protein. </p>

            <p class="text-content">Our LAME model is initiated with the photocleavage of a PhoCl Linker that leads to the release of the TF in the cells cytoplasm. Therefore, we thought it would be interesting to evaluate the effect
                different light intensities had on the concentration and rates of expression of RFP protein in the cell. The values we selected to test fell within the range of 0 W/cm<sup>2</sup> and
                54 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, where 0 W/cm<sup>2</sup> represented our system in its off state and 54 W/cm<sup>2</sup> represented the maximum light intensity mammalian cells can withstand

            <p class="text-content">We decided to optimize the rate-limiting parameters present in the ODE which describes the translation of RFP protein in the cell.

                We decided to optimise the values for each parameter by using two approaches, a Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Sampling. The maximum and minimum values that could be assigned to each parameter were determined from literature. </p>

            <p class="text-content"> We determined increasing light intensity has a directly proportional increasing effect on the concentration
                and the rate of expression of RFP in the cell. We therefore decided to evaluate the effect other light properties would have on our system. More specifically, we wanted to evaluate whether light pulsing had an effect on RFP expression. This would allow us to see whether by periodically activating and
                deactivating our light induced system we would observe the expression of a larger concentration of RFP, at a faster rate, in the cells.
                <br>
                <br>We first ran a control simulation, where we introduced one long pulse of 7 hours of light, to ensure we received a curved response that would simulate the activation and deactivation of our cellular mechanisms over a defined period of time. </p>

This is justifiable, as when the light is turned off we expect the rate of product production to become smaller than the rate of product degradation. Therefore, as time passes the concentration of each product from each step is expected to decrease.
                <br>
                <br> We then wanted to evaluate the effect pulsing, for periods of 2 hours, would have on the rate kinetics involved in the expression of RFP in the cytoplasm of the cell.</p>

In addition, the lower the d<sub>3</sub> value the slower the degradation of mRNA in the cell. Thus, the combination of both of these phenomena results in a faster and greater concentration of RFP expressed in the cytoplasm of the cell.</p>

                <p class="text-content"> We ran our rate kinetics model with our newly optimized parameters and determined that with our optimized parameters a larger concentration of RFP was expressed in the cytoplasm of the cell. However, the same amount of time was taken for the RFP expression rate to plateau. Therefore, this
                    means that although the concentration of RFP expressed in the cytoplasm of the cell was optimized this step prevails as the rate-limiting step in the network of cellular mechanisms involved.</p>

                <p class="text-content"> We ran a  Cost Analysis to ensure our LIT optogenetic tool was an affordable technology current labs could use to replace alternative technologies.
                    We focused on identifying the main operational costs a user would incur. We determined the most critical ones were: the light intensity they used to activate the HEK 293 cellular mechanism; and the frequency of light pulsing.
                    We created a function in Python that took costs incurred for both methods into consideration, where we attempted to identify the most cost-efficient operational conditions for our tool.</p>

                <br>
                    We decided to plot both the costs incurred for different light intensities and the pulsing durations on the same graph to evaluate their synergistic effect.
                    The most optimum operating conditions for our optogenetic tool were defined as those at which both lines intersect. Beyond the point of intersection it was evident that the operational costs
                    for the optogenetic tool were too high. Below the intersection point it was evident that the activity of the HEK 293 cell adhesion mechanism would
                    be too slow, and as one of the biggest selling points of our technology is its rapidity we decided it would not be practical to
                    operate at such a slow rate.

                    <br>
                    Therefore, the best trade-off was identified when operating at a light intensity of 30 W/cm<sup>2</sup> with a 4.5 hour pulsing frequency.</p>

                <h1 class="subtitle">Pharmaceutical Industry</h1>

                <p class="text-content">We envision our model could be adapted and used by pharmaceutical companies to optimize their
                    Downstream Processing conditions to obtain a high product yield. Focus could be placed on identifying the bottleneck
                    of the manufacturing process, or the stage at which the greatest concentration of product is lost in the manufacturing process.
                    Each differential equation could represent a batch mode taking place in one-unit operations, where the product concentration
                    changes over time. For each equation, we would include the loss of product in the form of degradation rates, as this would
                    signal a decrease in product concentration. For each of these conditions a discount factor for the product concentration
                    would need to be introduced. The product loss could be due to: the product getting stuck in crevices in the machinery;
                    product degradation due to a limited half-life; and/or product aggregation to other cellular debris. This model would help
                    companies determine the unit operation at which the largest product loss is experienced.
